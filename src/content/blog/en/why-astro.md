## Introduction

After 5 years of WordPress development, I've recently been focusing on Astro.

## Why Astro

### 1. Zero JS by Default

Astro ships zero client-side JavaScript by default. You only add what you need.

### 2. Low Learning Curve

HTML-based `.astro` files are familiar to developers used to PHP templates.

### 3. Fast Builds

Static site generation delivers exceptional loading speeds.

## Conclusion

It's an optimal choice for content-focused sites.
